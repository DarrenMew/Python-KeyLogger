<h1>Python Keylogger</h1>
<h3>The program starts by capturing all system infomation and creating the file logfile.txt (original I know)</h3>
<h3>The program will then proceed to capture any keys being typed on the keyboard and write those to the file</h3>


<h2> For improving this I would definetly like a better way to handle certain special keys like shift and space for now I just leave those on their own line however I think this would increase the file size quite alot</h2>
<h2>Another thing I would impemnet is to have email functionality I tried this but it didnt work well and since the file is not formated nicely there really isnt much point especially since this whole thing was done purley as and education experierment to see how easy it would be to implement</h2>
